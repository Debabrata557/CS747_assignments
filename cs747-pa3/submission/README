To generate graphs do ./plot_for.sh epsilon alpha episodes s k algos

s=1 if you want to add stochastic wind
k=1 if king's moves are allowed

algos can be any non empty subset from [q_learning,sarsa,e_sarsa]

the algos should be separated by space

e.g ./plot_for.sh 0.1 0.5 200 0 1 sarsa q_learning

The above will generate a plot (having name same as arguments) that will compare q_learning algorithm and sarsa with the same parameters that given as above.

q_learning = Q learning

sarsa = Sarsa

e_sarsa = Expected Sarsa

Please make sure to give the arguments in proper order and not to omit any arguments.

P.S : The graphs are plotted with the average data over 50 seeds.
